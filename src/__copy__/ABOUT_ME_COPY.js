Using technologies such as JavaScript and React, I can create anything from a single page application (SPA) to something more involved like a full-stack app.";

const secondParagraph = "I am currently going through Keith J. Grant's 'CSS in Depth', as I believe writing non-hacky, maintainable CSS is an often important yet unrecognized skill. I am also working on my UX design, as I want to make sure that my applications are as easy and convenient for the user as possible. When I'm not working on some code, you can find me enjoying a nice Stephen King novel or improving my skills in the kitchen.";
