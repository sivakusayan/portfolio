  description: 'Visual Graham Scan is a responsive, educational web app that gives a step-by-step playthrough of an algorithm to compute convex hulls. This project was originally a command line tool I wrote for my Computational Geometry class. Since algorithm visualizations are one of the coolest things in the world, I figured that I had to give my classwork a little upgrade.',
